### Challenges (you can include images and code block here)
1. Getting the random symbol and name to be typed to match when executing a random function
2. Allowing the player to play multiple game. The main issue was the fact that I was executing the timer within the start game function, meaning the timer became quicker with each game played.
3. Allowing multiple difficulties to be accessed on the same page.
4. Using the package containing the array of all the elements, managed to do a workaround.

### Learning points
1. Gained knowledge of how to use javascript and the intricacies involved with creating a game, such as linking  functions and setting global variables.
2. Learned how to plan and how useful it it to plan properly to allow better time allocation to the individual parts of the project.
